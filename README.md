# Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System
This project is a thread-safe, in-memory bus ticket reservation system developed using core Java. It exposes REST APIs to check seat availability and reserve tickets while ensuring no overbooking under concurrent requests.

The system simulates a real-world bus journey with multiple stops and supports partial seat reuse across journey segments, making it more realistic than simple seat-count approaches.
